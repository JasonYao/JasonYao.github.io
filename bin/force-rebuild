##
# Sometimes, Github builds pages inconsistently, and has been observed
#   multiple times to serve up stale content (tested in both Chrome
#   and Firefox in private browsers with caches off), causing pretty
#   blatant issues due to SRI protections now showing mismatched hashes
#   and minified file names, even if the `publish` branch in the
#   github repo shows the correct filepath and SHA hash.
#
# This script is meant to try and fix that, by triggering a new
#   github pages build in one command, and hoping that the rebuild
#   clears whatever weird thing is going on with github.
#
# NOTE: This will change the SHA hash of the latest commit, and
#   NOT pollute the git history with empty commits, so be cognizant
#   if others end up doing stuff to this repo.
