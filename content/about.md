Hi- if you're on this page you're likely either a friend looking
for stuff to poke fun at me with, or a recruiter trying to figure
out if I'm:
1. Competent
1. Looking for opportunities

I assure you that even I don't know the answer to those questions.

Either way, welcome!

## General info
I am:
- A New York based software engineer, currently working at **Squarespace**
  on their **Domains team** since March 2018
- A nerd that can talk your ear off about everything from public transportation
  to fire codes, and be able to tie it back somehow to software engineering
- Somebody who once made [spicy rice cakes](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tteokbokki)
  without the rice cakes (don't ask)
- Canadian born, Hong Kong raised, American educated, and probably trying
  (and failing) to find something equivalent to [Wah Fung](https://goo.gl/maps/KgPHw6D6Eg2fwNCs6)'s
  quality and price (seriously, $5.50 USD for the equivalent to 2 meals of meat
  is just crazy).

### Education
Like all NYU alumni, I too chose that great school to learn in
after getting rejected from Columbia for the 7th time.

There may or may not be a video of me singing "Hey there Columbia" to
the tune of "Hey there Delilah" floating around somewhere.

Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Courant at New York University, 2017 grad.

## For my friends
For those in the former group, a hint: there's 7 secrets on this site,
with our variation of the Konami code unlocking one of them. Message
on discord if you ever find them, and I'll treat you to a drink.

## For recruiters
For those in the latter group, my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonyaonyu/)
should be up to date with my work history, what I've worked on,
things I've lead or done, etc.

I'll be up-front on one aspect, in that in general
**I don't work with third party recruiters**, so if you are
one please save both of us some time and send me your favorite
food recipe instead, with no expectations that I'll respond to
inquiries.

I'm also not open to relocating from New York city, mostly
because NYC and Montreal are the only places to get an
actually good bagel.

## The part where I'm supposed to brag or something i dunno
For a "Top Hits" of my work:
- [2017] On [MediaMath](https://www.mediamath.com/)'s Financial Platforms
  team, I was directly responsible for lowering the runtime latency of
  advertising strategy pricing calculations from the previous 2 hours
  to less than 7 minutes, **resulting in a latency reduction of over 94.1667%**,
  that directly impacted over 80% of company revenue, and saved millions
  of dollars from having up-to-date information. For this project, I was
  the tech and team lead for 3 other engineers.
- [2018 - 2021] On [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)'s Domains
  team, I was the first engineer hired for the Domain Registrar project,
  writing the foundational and feature code powering the project, from the
  lower level TLS security/EPP over TCP code, to full DNR features like
  domain management and registrations, which converted the DNA of Squarespace
  from a website hosting company into a full-fledged Domain Name Registrar
  (DNR), which resulted in **many** improvements, including:
  - Increasing stability of the product to target a 99.99% uptime SLA,
    compared to the previous <90% SLA when using the previous 3rd party
    provider DNR
  - Decreasing latency of DNR features like domain registrations from
    over 30s on average with the previous 3rd party provider to <100ms,
    **a decrease of over 99.6667% decrease**
- [2000 -> present] I still manage to trip on flat surfaces somehow.
- [2020] While at Squarespace, I also designed, proposed, and led the
  development on an internal generalized fraud detection system, first
  targeting domains as part of the MVP. This system was responsible for
  **increasing the number of identified fraudulent domains by over 3.5 times
  the baseline**, all while maintaining a low false positive rate, and enabled
  Squarespace to begin taking a proactive approach to fraudulent behavior,
  instead of a reactive one.


## Pure self-promotional shilling written back in 2017
> Honestly it's kinda fun to take a look back at this
stuff now, even if it feels a bit cringy

I problem-solve based on understanding the trade-offs in a potential
solution. Knowing runtime and space complexities, and leveraging them
for an optimal solution.

Whether it's creating simple automated daemons, full desktop applications,
or designing and building automatically recovering distributed systems,
I can do it all or lead a team to do it even better.

Need web APIs? Full websites? A horizontally scalable web
service that needs 5 9's of up-time?

I can do all of that, and more. Python, C, Java, web frameworks like
Spring or Django, and everything in between.

Proficient in many languages, and fast learner for those that I haven't
learned yet. I use the best language for the job that's required, and learn
a language specifically to do the job well.

I think through the processes required to reach the end goal, while keeping
in mind the fact that requirements may change, or new technologies may emerge.

I'll be the first one in and the last one out when it comes to improving
my software engineering skills to their full potential.

Engaging with peers, reading books, and going to conferences to learn about
the bleeding-edge of technology, and how I can leverage it in my current
workflow.
